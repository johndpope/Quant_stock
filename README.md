# Quant_stock
Stock analysis/prediction model using machine learning using the impact between different out-of-the-market factors (weather, etc.) and the stock prices.

---

## Models used
There are three ML model that are being implemented:
* A simple feedforward neural network
* A recurrent neural network with LSTM (long short term memory)
* A convolutional neural network

## Accuracy measurements
The pipeline implemented is using [backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com) to implement backtesting in order to test each individual strategy.

## Usage
run `python driver.py -t model_name` to train

run `python driver.py -b model_name` to backtest the model
